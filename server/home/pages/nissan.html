                    <b>Nissan Motor Company Ltd</b> , usually shortened to Nissan , is a Japanese multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Nishi-ku, Yokohama. The company sells its cars under the Nissan, Infiniti, and Datsun brands with in-house performance tuning products labelled Nismo.<br>

                <p class="textCar">
                    Masujiro Hashimoto founded the Kaishinsha Motor Car Works 1 July 1911; 106 years ago in Tokyo's Azabu-Hiroo district, Japan's first automobile manufacturer. In 1914, the company produced its first car, called DAT.<br>
                    The new car's model name was an acronym of the company's investors' surnames:<br>
                    Kenjiro Den <br>
                    Rokuro Aoyama <br>
                    Meitaro Takeuchi <br>
                    It was renamed to Kaishinsha Motorcar Co., Ltd. in 1918, and again to DAT Jidosha & Co., Ltd. (DAT Motorcar Co.) in 1925. DAT Motors built trucks in addition to the DAT and Datsun passenger cars. The vast majority of its output were trucks, due to an almost non- existent consumer market for passenger cars at the time, and disaster recovery efforts as a result of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.
