                <p class="textCar">
                    The company was founded in R端sselsheim, Hessen, Germany, on January 21, 1862, by Adam Opel. At the beginning, Opel just produced sewing machines in a cowshed in R端sselsheim. Above all, his success was based on his perfectly customized sewing machines. Because of the quick growth of his business, in 1888, the production was relocated from the cowshed to a more spacious building in R端sselsheim. Encouraged by success, Adam Opel launched a new product in 1886: He began to sell high-wheel bicycles, also known as penny-farthings. Besides, Opel's two sons participated in high-wheel bicycle races, thus promoting this means of transportation. Therefore, the production of high-wheel bicycles soon exceeded the production of sewing machines. At the time of Opel's death in 1895, he was the leader in both markets.
